### **Cyber Attack Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

Cybersecurity is one of the most critical concerns in the digital world, where cyber threats continue to evolve in complexity. This project focuses on **Cyber Attack Prediction using Machine Learning**, aiming to build a robust model that can accurately detect cyber attacks.  

#### **Project Overview**  
The dataset for this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, containing diverse cyber attack instances. To gain deeper insights, I conducted an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns, detect anomalies, and determine the most influential variables for building a predictive model.  

I implemented multiple **machine learning models**, including:  
- **Logistic Regression** – A baseline model for binary classification.  
- **Decision Tree** – To understand the decision-making process behind attack detection.  
- **Random Forest** – To enhance predictive accuracy through an ensemble approach.  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** – A deep learning model that outperformed all other models in terms of detecting cyber attacks with high precision.  

#### **Key Enhancements & Model Optimization**  
To ensure the models are not only accurate but also generalizable, I applied several optimization techniques:  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and structured data by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and transforming raw data into a machine-readable format.  
- **Outlier Removal:** Detected and removed extreme data points to prevent skewed model performance.  
- **Feature Scaling & Normalization:** Standardized features and normalized the target variable to mitigate the impact of class imbalance.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimized the models using techniques like Grid Search and Randomized Search CV to achieve the best possible performance.  
- **Overfitting Prevention:** Implemented **cross-validation**, **dropout layers** (for CNN), and **regularization techniques** (L1 & L2) to enhance model generalization.  

#### **Performance & Results**  
After training and fine-tuning the models, CNN emerged as the **best-performing model**, achieving the highest accuracy and precision in detecting cyber attacks. The model effectively differentiates between normal and attack traffic, making it a valuable tool for **real-time cyber threat detection**.  

#### **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates the power of **machine learning in cybersecurity**, showcasing how predictive modeling can be leveraged to detect and mitigate cyber threats effectively. The combination of **EDA, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and deep learning techniques** significantly improved the model’s performance, making it an efficient cyber attack prediction system.  

This solution can be further extended by integrating **real-time monitoring**, **anomaly detection systems**, and **adaptive learning models** to strengthen cybersecurity defenses in dynamic environments.
