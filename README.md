# Cyber-Attack-Prediction-using-ML
This project focuses on cyber attack prediction using machine learning with data from Kaggle. After performing EDA, models like logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and CNN were implemented, with CNN performing best. Techniques like hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling improved accuracy, making it useful for threat detection.
